A sample of original MNIST dataset in a CSV format. Instead of using full dataset with 60000 training examples the dataset consists of just 10000 examples.

Each row in the dataset consists of 785 values: the first value is the label (a number from 0 to 9) and the remaining 784 values (28x28 pixels image) are the pixel values (a number from 0 to 255).
